# HCheat

Simple mod that adds stronger sandbox items.
Currently, it has:
- OP Item, Liquid and Power sources.
- Mega fast (stack-)conveyor.
- Very capacitive battery.
- OP Power node, w/ longer distance, and connections count.
- 1-shot turret.
- Unbreakable wall.
This mod is just for learning Mindustry modding.

TODO:
- Make OP regenerator, (and a thing that makes your building go faster).
- Make universal factory.
- Make a tech tree entry.
- ~~Copy~~ Make things from Invincible Cheat.
- ~~Actually make a useful mod.~~
